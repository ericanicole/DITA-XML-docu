        <p class="p">Division is a mathematical operation; it is a process or action that you do with numbers.
            Division allows you to split a number or an amount into equal parts.</p>

        <p class="p">You use the divide (also known as <em class="ph i">obelus</em>) (÷) button to express the division
            operation in the app. The result is known as the quotient.</p>

        <p class="p">In the division process, a number divided by another number is shared into equal
            groups.</p>

        <p class="p">For example, “6 divided by 3” means “6 shared into 3 equal groups”, which would be 2.
            This is shown as 6 ÷ 3 = 2.</p>
